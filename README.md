# Knack Geolocation Selector

This React app creates a geospatial picker that can display, drop, and edit location pins in the Knack Signs and Markings application. Data about the points is passed between the Knack app and the React app using iframe messaging.

## Local development

Clone this repo and create a feature branch

In `iFrameMapMessenger.js` of the new branch, update the iframe `src` to https://localhost:9001/

Push your branch to Github. This is necessary for the custom JS in Knack (stored in `/knack/index.js`) to load code that will point the Knack app to the locally hosted React app.

Working from a test instance of the Signs & Markings Knack application, update `production` in the `url` variable in `loadIframeMapMessenger()` to the name of your branch.

To start the React app, you can run:

### `npm run proxy`

The proxy is necessary for the iFrame messages to push back and forth between the React app and Knack.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
